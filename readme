# Weather Agent POC

This repository contains a minimal FastAPI backend that demonstrates how a natural-language prompt can be interpreted by an agent, translated into weather API calls, and rendered into a downloadable PDF artifact.

## Running locally

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```

Then call the API:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/weather-report \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"prompt": "Give me a business summary of temperature and rain in Austin next week"}' \
  --output weather.pdf
```

The API returns a PDF compiled from live Open-Meteo data. The prompt interpreter is intentionally simple for the POC but can be replaced with an LLM-backed agent.
